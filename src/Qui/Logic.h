/*!
 *  \file Logic.h 
 *
 *  \brief Defines the interface used in the Logic module.
 *
 *  This Logic module allows the set up of Rules based on state-dependent
 *  Conditions.  The evaluation is delayed, which means that the Condition is
 *  not tested until the Rule is applied.  Conditions can change their state
 *  during their life time.
 *
 *  A \typedef Condition is any function that takes zero arguments and returns a
 *  boolean.  This means the state must be held internal to the function.
 *
 *  A \typedef Action is any function that takes zero arguments and returns
 *  nothing.
 *
 *  A \typedef Rule is simply a Condition combined with up to two actions, one to
 *  take if the Condition is true and the other to take if it is false.
 *
