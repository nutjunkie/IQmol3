   /// 
   /// Assumptions:
   ///   - only one grid per file is supported
   ///   - if the number of voxels is positive, units are in bohr
   ///   - if the number of voxels is negative, units are in angstrom
   ///   - units cannot be mixed
   ///   - voxels can have different lengths along each dimension
   ///   - voxel axes must be aligned with the cartesian axes
   ///   - data loops in the order x, y, z, so the z data varies fastest
   ///   - all data is separated by whitespace
   ///
